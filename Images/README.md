# Image Naming Guideline 

## Process/Workflow when capturing an image on desktop device

Desktop device images can be unique to the version of Windows they are captured on.  Capture image from device and append device OS to image. Examples would be: 
  >Button_Done_Windows10
  
  >Icon_Cerner_Windows7

#### For actual examples refer to [DSKWindows/Button_StartMenu](https://github.cerner.com/EggPlant/IPDEV-Desktop-Shared/tree/master/Desktop-Shared.suite/Images/DSKWindows/Button_StartMenu)
